## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is a Standard in Networking?
Discover the importance of network standards and how they ensure compatibility and interoperability among devices and applications.
- Network standards encompass physical characteristics, electrical specifications, and protocols.
  
### The Main Difference Between OSI and TCP/IP Models
Learn about the contrasting features of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) and TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) models.
- OSI is a comprehensive, protocol-independent framework, while TCP/IP is a practical model addressing specific communication challenges.
  
### Why Do We Use Subnetting?
Explore the benefits of subnetting, including improved network control, enhanced security, and efficient IP address usage.
- Subnetting provides network administrators with better control over their networks and boosts performance.

## Networking Layers

### Physical Layer
The Physical Layer, as per the OSI and TCP/IP models, deals with hardware and signaling mechanisms.
- It handles host-to-host communication, defining transmission mediums and communication modes.
- This layer operates at the bit level.

#### Signals
- Digital signals are discrete, representing sequences of voltage pulses.
- Analog signals are continuous waveforms represented by continuous electromagnetic waves.

#### Multiplexing
- Multiplexing allows multiple streams of transmission to share a single link.
- Types of multiplexing include Frequency Division Multiplexing, Time Division Multiplexing, Wavelength Division Multiplexing, and Code Division Multiplexing.

#### Switch
A switch is network hardware that connects devices and forwards data using packet switching.

#### Switching
Switching involves forwarding packets based on forwarding tables. It can be connectionless or connection-oriented.

### Data Link Layer
The Data Link Layer is the second layer of the OSI model and has two sub-layers: Logical Link Control and Media Access Control.
- It handles protocols, flow control, error control, and hardware addressing.
- This layer ensures efficient communication between devices.

### Network/Internet Layer
The Network Layer manages host and network addressing, routing, and internetworking.
- It routes packets from source to destination within or outside a subnet.
- The layer addresses devices and networks, populates routing tables, and supports quality of service constraints.

#### Network Addressing
Network addressing includes unicast, multicast, broadcast, and anycast addresses.

#### Routing
Routing selects the best path for data to travel based on metrics like hop count, bandwidth, and delay.

#### Routing Table
A routing table stores information about how to reach network destinations and can include Directly Attached Network IDs, Remote Network IDs, Host Routes, Default Routes, and Destinations.

#### Routing Types
- Unicast Routing: For specific destinations.
- Broadcast Routing: No routing, broadcast packets are forwarded locally.
- Multicast Routing: Sent only to nodes that request the data.
- Anycast Routing: Sent to the nearest node with the same logical address.

### Internetworking
Internetworking involves routing between two networks.

### Network Layer Protocols
Key protocols at the Network Layer include ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4), and IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6).

## Subnetting
Subnetting is the process of dividing a single physical network into logical sub-networks (subnets).

- Learn more about subnetting by watching the [Subnetting Calculation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHRPtNZ_Rz4) in the "Tutorials and Learning Materials" section.
